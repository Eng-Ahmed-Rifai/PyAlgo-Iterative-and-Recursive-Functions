# Iterative and Recursive Functions and Binary Search Examples

## Code Description
The code in this project includes two iterative and recursive functions and an iterative binary search function. The iterative function calculates the factorial of a number using a for loop. The recursive function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. The binary search function searches for an element in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm.

## Benefits of the technology used in the project
The benefits of using these coding techniques are that they provide efficient solutions to common programming problems. The binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), which makes it an efficient search algorithm for large arrays. The recursive function allows for a more concise and readable solution to problems that involve repetitive computations.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as follows:

1. The first function is `getfactorialIterative(num)`, which calculates the factorial of a number iteratively using a for loop.
2. The second function is `getfactorialrecursively(num)`, which calculates the factorial of a number recursively.
3. The third function is `binary_search(arr, x)`, which performs binary search on a sorted array to find a specific element.
4. The code includes test cases to demonstrate the functionality of each function.

## Difference between Two Coding Methods :
The iterative and recursive functions provide two different ways to solve the same problem. The iterative function uses a for loop to perform a repetitive computation, while the recursive function breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and solves them recursively. The iterative function may be more efficient in some cases, while the recursive function may be more readable and easier to understand.
